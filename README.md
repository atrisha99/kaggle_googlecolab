# kaggle_googlecolab
To get the dataset from the Kaggle to the Google Colab.
It already exists in Official Kaggle website and Many youtubers have explained too. 
For my personal reference i am going to put them all together so its easier to copy paste to google colab.
One thing to remember is to download Kaggle API from your profile.
If its a compitition then accept the rules and all otherwise it will throw a forbidden error.
If its a normal dataset then see the URL and take it from there!!!
