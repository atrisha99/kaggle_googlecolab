# kaggle_googlecolab
To get the dataset from the Kaggle to the Google Colab
It alreadyt exists in Official Kaggle website and Many youtubers have explained too
For my personal refernce i am going to put them all together so its easier to copy paste to google colab
One thing to remember is to download Kaggle API from your profile
If its a compitition then accept the rules and all otherwise it will throw a forbidden error
If its a normal dataset then see the URL and take it from there!!!
